This project aims to build a single-user web app for managing tasks, prioritizing them, and timeboxing into a calendar with Google Calendar and iCal integration. It also includes guided daily/weekly planning, focus/playlist sessions, imports, and auto-scheduling to fit work inside user-defined hours.
